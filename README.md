Elasticsearch Apps
==================

What is Elasticsearch Apps?
---------------------------

Elasticsearch Apps is a tool for instrumenting the Maven artifact dependency mechanism for downloding and resolving Elasticsearch plugins and their dependencies. 

It extends the ``PluginManager``, the ``PluginService`` and the ``PluginsModule`` classes in ``org.elasticsearch.plugins``. Existing Elasticsearch plugins, which are offered as zip file downloads, can be used without modification.

The tool ``bin/apps`` is aimed to replace ``bin/plugins``. It works similar, but uses the JBoss ShrinkWrap resolver project to handle with Maven artifacts in remote repositories.

The config file ``config/elasticsearch.yml`` is enriched by additional entries for declaring the Elasticsearch apps.

Apps are divided into three groups:

- plugin apps, downloaded as a zip file from an URL
- site apps, downloaded as a zip file from an URL
- Maven artifact apps, with dependencies 


How to set it up
----------------

For the Maven part, there is a new configuration file ``config/apps.xml`` which is equivalent to the Maven ``settings.xml``. In this file, Maven repositories for Elasticsearch can be configured. 

This is a verbose sample of a ``config/apps.xml`` which just activates the Maven central repo where the Elasticsearch core plugins already live.

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<!-- see http://maven.apache.org/settings.html -->
	<settings>
		<!-- if you want your Maven local repo equal to Elasticsearch apps local repo -->
		<!-- <localRepository>file://${user.home}/.m2/repository</localRepository> -->
		<!-- Elasticsearch apps local repo-->
		<localRepository>plugins/repository</localRepository>
		<!-- set offline to true to disable any network access when accessing repos. Default is false. -->
		<!--  <offline>true</offline>  -->
		<profiles>
			<!-- 
				The default active profile. Add your remote Maven repositories here.
			-->
			<profile>
				<id>apps</id>
				<activation>
					<activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
				</activation>
				<repositories>
					<repository>
						<id>central</id>
						<name>Maven Repository</name>
						<url>http://repo1.maven.org/maven2</url>
						<layout>default</layout>
						<snapshots>
							<enabled>false</enabled>
						</snapshots>
					</repository>
				</repositories>
			</profile>    
		</profiles>	
	</settings>

Now the Maven resolver is ready.

Adding your plugin declarations to Elasticsearch configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------

You can add the plugins you want to declare to be installed by adding some lines to ``config/elasticsearch.yml``. 

This short example declares the icu plugin with a given version:

    apps.dependencies.analysis-icu.dependency: org.elasticsearch:elasticsearch-analysis-icu:1.7.0

This longer example declares the head plugin as a zip download, and a mandatory analysis-icu plugin, where all versions from 1.0.0 until the current version are valid:

	########################### Apps #############################################
	
	apps:
	  mandatory:
		org.elasticsearch:elasticsearch-analysis-icu
	  sites:
		elasticsearch-head:
		  url: https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head/archive/master.zip
		  enabled: true
	  excludes: [
		  "org.elasticsearch:elasticsearch",      
		  "log4j:log4j"
	  ]
	  dependencies:
		analysis-icu:
		  dependency: org.elasticsearch:elasticsearch-analysis-icu:[1.0.0,)
		  enabled: true
	  
That's it. Now, by just starting up an Elasticsearch node, the declared apps are automatically downloaded from remote repository sites and activated.

The command for executing a node in the foreground is

    bin/elasticsearch -f


The ``bin/apps`` tool
---------------------

It is often convenient to investigate for the latest versions of plugins, or looking up what plugins exist without starting a node. The ``bin/apps`` tool is a standalone version of the app service. It's purpose is to offer convenient services to manage plugin apps as a "one stop shop".

You can control the plugin resolving and installation with this tool.

When starting ``bin/apps``, it reads the configuration files, and begins with the download and artifact resolution process, and then opens a console.

Here is a quick overview of the artifact-related commands:

``ls`` - shows a list of the installed Elasticsearch artifact apps, site plugin apps, and legacy plugins

``resolve <artifact>`` - show all dependencies of the artifact, where the artifact is given in Maven canonical form
	
``install <artifact>`` - creates an artifact app out of a dependency by looking for es-plugin.properties on the classpath and instantiating the plugin class
	
``remove <artifact>`` - removes an artifact from the local app repository	
	
``tree <artifact>`` - shows all the dependencies of the given artifact as a tree
	
``whatrequires <artifact>`` - for a given Maven artifact, show all Elasticsearch apps that depend on it (work in progress)

More commands to follow.

Under development
=================

The Elasticsearch apps effort is currently under development.
